We are particularly interested in complex reasoning about entities and relations in text and large-scale\r\nknowledge bases (KBs). This paper proposes three significant modeling advances: (1) we learn to jointly reason about relations, entities, and entity-types; (2) we use neural attention\r\nmodeling to incorporate multiple paths; (3) we learn to share strength in a single RNN that represents logical composition\r\nacross all relations. On a largescale Freebase+ClueWeb prediction task, we achieve 25% error reduction, and a 53% error reduction on sparse relations due to shared strength. On chains of reasoning in WordNet we reduce error in mean quantile by 84% versus previous state-of-the-art.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n##Dependencies\r\n\r\n- [torch](https://github.com/torch/torch7)\r\n- [nn](https://github.com/torch/nn)\r\n- [rnn](https://github.com/Element-Research/rnn)\r\n- [optim](https://github.com/torch/optim)\r\n- [cunn](https://github.com/torch/cunn) (optional: required if you train on GPU)\r\n\r\n\r\n## Instructions for running the code\r\n\r\n### Data\r\nGet the data from [here](http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/downloads/akbc16/). (Note: This might change soon, as I will release an updated version of the dataset)\r\n\r\nTo get the correct format to run the models, \r\n```shell\r\ncd data\r\n/bin/bash make_data_format.sh <path_to_input_data> <output_dir>\r\n```\r\nFor example you can run,\r\n```shell\r\ncd data\r\n/bin/bash make_data_format.sh examples/data_small_input examples/data_small_output\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Model\r\nTo start training, first checkout [run_scripts/config.sh](run_scripts/config.sh). This defines all the hyperparams and other inputs to the network. After specifying model parameters, to start training run,\r\n\r\n```shell\r\ncd run_sripts\r\n/bin/bash train.sh ./config.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n###Path Query Experiment on WordNet (Sec 5.5 of the paper)\r\nCheckout the instructions of the readme page in [wordnet_experiment/README.md](wordnet_experiment/README.md).\r\n\r\n###Contact:\r\nFeel free to email me with any questions you have at rajarshi@cs.umass.edu\r\n\r\n",
