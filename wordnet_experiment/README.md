#Path Query experiment comparing Guu et al. (2015) on the WordNet dataset

##Data
Download the datasets released by the original paper [here](https://worksheets.codalab.org/worksheets/0xfcace41fdeec45f3bc6ddf31107b829f/)

For evaluation, you will also need to have the negative entities for each target entity. You can get that by running data/get_negative_examples.py. (You have to run it in the original code repository.). I am unable to share the negative entities because of the data limit of github repositories.
